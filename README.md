## Hi there 👋

🔭 I’m currently working on a team project for a public organization, developing a website with features like volunteer applications, donation tracking, and payment integration using LiqPay, all while improving my backend development skills.

🌱 I’m currently learning Java Multithreading, Kotlin and expanding my expertise with technologies like Docker, AWS, Redis, Kafka.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on innovative backend projects that involve API development.

🤔 I’m looking for help with perfecting my portfolio projects and gaining insights into building scalable backend architectures for real-world applications.
